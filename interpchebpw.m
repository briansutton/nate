function p = interpchebpw(ps,asbs)
%INTERPCHEBPW   Interpolation on a piecewise-Chebyshev grid.
%
%   P = INTERPCHEBPW(PS,ASBS) constructs a piecewise-polynomial interpolant
%   P with given values on a piecewise-Chebyshev grid. The subintervals of
%   the piecewise grid do not have to be of equal width.
%
%   Inputs:
%
%     PS: an (M+1)-by-N matrix containing values of the interpolant on the
%     piecewise-Chebyshev grid
%
%     ASBS = [ A1 A2 ... AN; B1 B2 ... BN ]: endpoints of the subintervals
%     [AJ,BJ] in the piecewise-defined grid
%
%   Outputs:
%
%     P: the interpolating polynomial
%
%   Let XS be the piecewise-Chebyshev grid consisting of a degree-M
%   Chebyshev grid on each subinterval. Then P is constructed so that
%   P(XS(I,J)) = PS(I,J). In addition, P is a polynomial of degree at most
%   M on each subinterval [AJ,BJ].
