<h1>Numerical Analysis: Theory and Experiments</h1>

<p><i>Numerical Analysis: Theory and Experiments<i> is a textbook on numerical
analysis. Numerical methods are designed and implemented, and then they are
analyzed through a combination of mathematical theory and numerical
experimentation. Problem areas include interpolation, integration, linear
systems, zero finding, and differential equations.</p>

<p>This package is a library of MATLAB routines that accompany the book.</p>



<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The library is installed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li> Download the package <a href="https://github.com/briansutton/nate/archive/master.zip">nate-master.zip</a>.
<li> Expand the zip file if it was not expanded automatically.
<li> Start MATLAB.
<li> Use the pathtool dialog to add the new package folder to the MATLAB
   path:

   <pre>>> pathtool</pre>

<li> Verify that the library routines are available as follows:

   <pre>>> nate
   Numerical Analysis: Theory and Experiments</pre>

<li> Set the Command Window preferences in MATLAB to 'long' numeric format and
   'compact' numeric display.
</ol>


<h2>Demonstration</h2>

<p>The following code computes and plots the arctan function.</pi>

<pre>
>> g = @(x) 1/(1+x^2); a = 0; b = 10;
>> fa = 0;
>> qs = samplecheb(g,[a b],60);
>> ps = antiderivcheb(fa,qs,[a b]);
>> p = interpcheb(ps,[a b]);
>> newfig;
>> plotfun(p,[a b],'displayname','p');
>> ylim([0 pi/2]);
>> legend('location','southeast');
</pre>
