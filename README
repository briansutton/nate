_Numerical_Analysis:_Theory_and_Experiments_ is a textbook on numerical
analysis. Numerical methods are designed and implemented, and then they are
analyzed through a combination of mathematical theory and numerical
experimentation. Problem areas include interpolation, integration, linear
systems, zero finding, and differential equations.

This package is a library of MATLAB routines that accompany the book.

Installation
------------

The library is installed as follows:

1. Download the package nate.zip.

2. Expand the zip file if it was not expanded automatically.

3. Start MATLAB.

4. Use the pathtool dialog to add the new package folder to the MATLAB
   path:

   >> pathtool

5. Verify that the library routines are available as follows:

   >> nate
   Numerical Analysis: Theory and Experiments

6. Set the Command Window preferences in MATLAB to 'long' numeric format and
   'compact' numeric display.
