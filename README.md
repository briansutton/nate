*Numerical Analysis: Theory and Experiments* is a textbook on numerical analysis. Numerical methods are designed and implemented, and then they are analyzed through a combination of mathematical theory and numerical experimentation. Problem areas include interpolation, integration, linear systems, zero finding, and differential equations.

This package is a library of MATLAB routines that accompany the book.

## Installation

The library is installed as follows:
1. Download the package [nate.zip](https://github.com/briansutton/nate/archive/master.zip).
1. Expand the zip file if it was not expanded automatically.
1. Start MATLAB.
1. Use the `pathtool` dialog to add the new package folder to the MATLAB path:
   ```
   >> pathtool
   ```
1. Verify that the library routines are available as follows:
   ```
   >> nate
   Numerical Analysis: Theory and Experiments
   ```
1. Set the Command Window preferences in MATLAB to `long` numeric format and `compact` numeric display.
